# eRum2018_async_shiny
Shiny demo named "Going async with Shiny" for the eRum 2018 event.

The async version of `Shiny` addresses the blocking behaviour between different user sessions. The blocking persists for the same user, which is an intentional [decision](https://github.com/rstudio/promises/issues/10#issuecomment-349357593) by Joe Cheng.
